      <p>Hi! This is Jingyi Mao.</p>
      <p>I'm currently a rising junior student at the University of Michigan majoring in
        Computer Science. I come from Suzhou, China and I had been living there for 20 years.
      I transferred to Umich and started majoring in Computer Science in 2021. 
      I'm most familiar with C and C++. In my free time, I love reading, watching movies, 
      cooking and trying different food!</p>
